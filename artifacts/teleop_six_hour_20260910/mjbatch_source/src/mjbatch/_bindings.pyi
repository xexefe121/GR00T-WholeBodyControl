class Batch:
    """
    N MuJoCo simulations stepped on a C++ thread pool.

    The model is copied at construction; edit it before. Calls are serialized.

    Each simulation is an mjSTATE_INTEGRATION vector plus warning counters, loaded
    into a per-thread mjData for each call, so memory scales with threads, not
    simulations. Models with sleep enabled are rejected: sleep bookkeeping lives
    outside mjtState.

    bind("state") returns the (N, nstate) integration states themselves, in
    mj_getState's mjSTATE_INTEGRATION order: opaque rows for copying, saving and
    restoring simulations, native dtype only. A row written is the simulation's
    state at its next call, with pending field writes applied on top; the field
    views are stale until then. reset discards it, as it discards a field write.

    bind(field) returns an (N, ...) array over an mjData field in MjData's layout.
    Input fields (the mjtState components and warning) are copied in before
    a physics call, element by element, where they changed since we last wrote
    them; every bound field is copied out after, and a derived field bound between
    calls is filled for a simulation by its next call. reset applies pending writes
    after mj_resetData and then runs mj_forward, so derived fields are valid. After
    step, sensordata and every derived field are one substep behind qpos and qvel,
    as with mj_step itself, unless the batch was made with forward=True, which ends
    every step with mj_forward so they are current, at the cost of one forward per
    simulation per call.

    expand(field) returns (N, ...) per-simulation values of an mjModel field, seeded
    from the model and applied before every physics call for that simulation.
    mjOption fields expand too, a scalar as (N,) and a vector as (N, size), so
    gravity, timestep, integrator and the solver settings are per simulation. Raising
    iterations or ls_iterations, or switching cone to elliptic, can make a simulation
    need more arena than the template sized the worker's mjData for; that surfaces as
    the usual trapped MuJoCo error naming it. enableflags cannot turn sleep on, for
    the reason the constructor rejects it. The first call allocates one model copy
    per thread. set_const runs mj_setConst per simulation and expands every field it
    changed, so derived constants are per simulation too; mjModel scalars it writes
    (flags, stat) are kept per simulation as well.

    Derived constants follow expanded inputs only after set_const, as with
    mj_setConst on one model. A MuJoCo error on a worker raises RuntimeError naming
    the first failing simulation; the others still ran, and the failing one keeps the
    state it had before the call, its writes still pending. The trap is a MuJoCo log
    handler installed at import; installing another handler later disables it.
